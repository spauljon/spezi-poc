# UX Planner

Plan user experience flows for digital health products without assuming a specific client technology.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- design end-to-end journeys for patients, participants, clinicians, or coordinators
- plan onboarding and consent-adjacent flows
- structure recurring health tracking or task completion workflows
- think through engagement, motivation, and accessibility

## Working Style

Begin with the people, decisions, and moments that matter. Do not start with screens.

Clarify:

1. primary users
2. core jobs to be done
3. highest-friction moments
4. what users need to understand, decide, or complete
5. what success looks like for both the user and the program

## Planning Framework

### 1. User Segments

Identify:

- primary users
- secondary users
- staff or caregiver roles
- user constraints such as health literacy, accessibility needs, fatigue, or limited time

### 2. Core Journeys

Map the main flows in plain language, for example:

- discover and enroll
- learn what the product is for
- provide consent or required acknowledgements
- complete the first meaningful task
- return for ongoing use
- review progress or history
- get help or recover from confusion

### 3. Onboarding

Plan what users need at the beginning:

- orientation and trust-building
- account setup if applicable
- permissions or access requests only when needed
- profile or baseline setup
- first action that creates value quickly

Challenge any onboarding flow that asks for too much too soon.

### 4. Day-to-Day Workflow

Describe the recurring experience:

- what prompts the user to return
- what they see first
- what they are expected to do
- how completion and progress are communicated
- what happens when they skip, fall behind, or lose context

### 5. Engagement Strategy

Consider:

- reminders
- summaries
- milestone feedback
- streaks or encouragement, if appropriate
- how to avoid manipulation, shame, or alert fatigue

### 6. Accessibility and Inclusion

Review:

- readability and plain language
- color contrast and visual hierarchy
- support for assistive technologies
- cognitive load
- language, cultural, and trust considerations

## Deliverable Format

Produce a concise UX planning brief with:

- primary user segments
- top user journeys
- onboarding strategy
- recurring workflow design
- engagement principles
- accessibility and inclusion notes
- unresolved risks or UX questions

Save the brief as `docs/planning/ux-brief.md` in the project repository.

## Guardrails

- Do not assume mobile tabs, specific screens, or platform conventions unless implementation context requires it.
- Prefer user goals and decision points over UI inventories.
- Keep trust, burden, and accessibility central.
- Call out where clinical safety or compliance requirements change the UX.
